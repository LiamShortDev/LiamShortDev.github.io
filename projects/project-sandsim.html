      <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve always been fascinated by simulation-based games and the beauty of simple systems producing complex behavior. This sandbox started as a challenge to replicate falling sand physics in a C# console app — using characters and colors to simulate material movement. Eventually, I ported it to HTML so it could run on the web and be played anywhere.
      </p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Detailed Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        The core of the simulation is a grid-based update loop where each cell represents a particle — sand, water, or rock. Sand falls down unless blocked, water flows sideways and falls when it can, and rock is static. Each frame, the grid updates in a predictable order, using simple rules to produce surprisingly organic behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the HTML version, I used the Canvas API to render the grid and JavaScript to handle mouse interaction and real-time updates. Optimizing for performance on larger grids required minimizing DOM operations and tightly controlling redraws.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
      <p>
        Getting realistic behavior from simple rules took a lot of tweaking — especially with water movement and making sure materials didn’t “clump” unrealistically. Translating it from C# to JavaScript while preserving performance and accuracy also required rethinking how the render loop and input system worked.
      </p>

      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>
        This project taught me how rewarding emergent systems can be — and how tricky they are to fine-tune. I learned a lot about simulation logic, 2D canvas rendering, and optimizing per-frame updates in web apps.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>If I Did It Again...</h2>
      <p>
        I’d love to expand the simulation with fire, smoke, oil, and more reactions. A bigger goal would be adding a UI for custom materials and a saving/loading system to share creations. I might also use WebGL for faster rendering at higher resolutions.
